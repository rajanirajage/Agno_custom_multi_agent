# Custom Multi-Agent Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`agno_custom_multi_agent.ipynb`) that demonstrates a custom multi-agent workflow built with Python.  
The notebook explores how multiple agents can interact, share information, and collaborate to solve tasks — useful for experimenting with AI agent-based systems.
